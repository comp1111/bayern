            <p>Although Christy was born in Hong Kong, she lived most of her life in the city of Vancouver in BC, Canada.  In addition to tabletop gaming, dogs, and miniature painting, she loves programming.  This is why she joined the CST program at BCIT where she hopes to graduate from the 2-year diploma program after completing an 8-month co-op term.</p>
            <p>Christy can be reached on Slack.</p>
