          <p>Although she was born in Hong Kong, Christy has lived most of her life in Vancouver, Canada.  In addition to tabletop gaming, miniature painting and playing with fluffy dogs, she loves programming.  This is why she joined the CST program at BCIT where she hopes to graduate from the program after completing an 8-month co-op term.</p>
          <p>Christy loves sushi (as pictured) and can be reached on Slack.</p>
