            <p> Ziming was born in China. Although he lived most his life there and loved his homeland very much, he still determined 
                to challenge himself and finally became a newbie in Vancouver BC. 
                In addition to Soocer and Anime, he loves video games. This is why he put a picture of Conan wearing the Bayern jersey on the left side
                and joined the CST program at BCIT. The area in Computing that Ziming is  
                most passionate about is game design. Needless to say, there is still a long distance for Ziming to take in CST program.</p>
