            <p>Justin was born and raised in Vancouver, BC.  He initially studied Kinesiology at SFU, but eventually realized that it wasn't right for him.  Lately, he has developed an interest in computer programming so he decided to pursue that interest at BCIT.  In his spare time, Justin likes to binge watch shows on Netflix and play volleyball.  His favourite foods are sushi, ramen and pasta.</p>
