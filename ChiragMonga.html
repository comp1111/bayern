            <p>Hi, my name is chirag and I am currently enrolled in the BCIT CST diploma program.
		Ever since I was a kid I have always had an interest in computers. 
		I enjoy coding very much and I love the program that I'm in. My enjoyment of computing mainly came from videogames.
		As I got older I realized that the games i enjoyed weren't as easy to make.</p>
