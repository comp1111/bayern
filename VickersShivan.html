            <p>Shivan spent most of his childhood living in the lower mainland, though he moved around often growing up. He came to really appreciate the diversity and quality of the food and drink choices in Vancouver which is convenient because there isn't much he likes more than pigging out. When he isn't stuffing his face with greasy, unhealthy food and drinking questionable amounts of beer, Shivan is usually listening to or playing music. He seems to be enjoying the company of the people he's met and his time at BCIT so far.</p>
